Improve your JDBC API skills
### Task
`ProductDao` provides an API that allow to access and manipulate products. Your job is to implement the *todo* section 
of that class using **JDBC API**. 
To verify your implementation, run `ProductDaoTest.java`


     
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with JDBC API, SQL and be able to write Java code

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
